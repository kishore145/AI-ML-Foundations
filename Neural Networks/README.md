# Artificial intelligence (AI) Foundations

Notebooks, code snipptes containing different AI algorithms for quick reference / cheat sheet. 

Credits - 
These are heavily inspired based on JonKrohn's lectures on deep learning which I found very useful. Be sure to check out his playlist on O'Riley or his youtube channel. 

Code execution - 
Most of the notebooks are created using Google Colab and can be executed directly from Colab via Open in Colab link in notebooks
